Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or ""coolie"" in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s. If Diaspora violates a sense of identity based on territorial integrity, then could ""culture"" serve as the basis for a shared identity?",,Fall.,SHUM 2101,,,,,,,,[nan],,,,,,,,,

Restrictionists in Congress sought to close the door through legislation or administrative regulation. Others, such as settlement house workers, sought to ""Americanize"" newcomers and assimilate them into the American population. Immigrants were often aware of the double message and sought to negotiate a place in American society that allowed them to succeed economically while retaining their identities. The debate continues today as millions of migrants from Latin America and Asia, documented and undocumented, arrive. After a discussion of indentured servitude and slavery (involuntary migration) this course seeks to examine the perennial debate over voluntary immigration through the eyes of both native-born Americans and through immigrants eyes to the present. ",,Fall.,AMST 4252,,,,,,,,[nan],,,,,,,,,

In addition to learning the contours of the surprising history of immigration to the United States from all corners of the world, including the impact of questions of legal status, gender, and race, students will strive to develop a sophisticated sense of the historical context of today's immigration debates and issues, with the opportunity to learn about these issues in Washington DC. In the late 19th century, for example, the native born often saw Southern Italian, Eastern European Jewish, and Chinese immigrants as threats to their jobs, their health, and their cultural values. Restrictionists in Congress sought to close the door through legislation or administrative regulation. Others, such as settlement house workers, sought to ""Americanize"" newcomers and assimilate them into the American population. Immigrants were often aware of the double message and sought to negotiate a place in American society that allowed them to succeed economically while retaining their identities. The debate continues today as millions of migrants from Latin America and Asia, documented and undocumented, arrive. After a discussion of indentured servitude and slavery (involuntary migration) this course seeks to examine the perennial debate over voluntary immigration through the eyes of both native-born Americans and through immigrants eyes to the present. ",,Fall.,HIST 4252,,,,,,,,[nan],,,,,,,,,

What prices we want to pay, how much we want to be paid, how assignments will be divided and credit allocated… all of these are negotiations. Yet while we negotiate routinely, many of us know very little about the strategy and psychology of effective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire? Negotiation is the art and science of securing an agreement between two or more interdependent parties. A person without a developed understanding of the social psychology and economics of effective negotiations cannot be an effective leader. We will discuss theories and principles to guide our negotiations (the science), and students will develop and sharpen their bargaining skills by actually negotiating with other students in experiential exercises (the art). Further, given that negotiations occur in so many aspects of life, your experience in this course should not only develop your professional skills but also facilitate your effectiveness in other life domains. The learning method is experiential. The course introduces a real-world toolkit for a strategic approach from pre-negotiation planning to post-negotiation evaluation.

They must make decisions about what to do and how to do it, whether in dealing with natural disasters, winning elections, and everything in between. They base those decisions on larger bodies of knowledge, whether political, economic, historical, ethical, or any of the other broad range of disciplines.

Special attention will be given to Roman and Medieval building typology, both private and public, and the development of the urban infrastructure (street system, water supply, fortifications, etc.). Strong emphasis will be placed upon continuity, use/reuse, and transformation of buildings and spaces, etc. Every week one or two different ""regions"" will be explored that are typical for a particular moment of the urban history.

In this course, we will examine current methods for intervening in the microbiome but focus primarily on cutting-edge technologies for microbiome-related therapeutics. This will include synthetic biology and genetic engineering approaches. Topics will include probiotics, antibiotics, drug discovery, live bacterial therapeutics, biosensors, phage therapies, bacterial evolution and engineering immune responses. We will touch on the safety implications of using different biological technologies. This course is designed for Masters-level students and advanced undergraduate students.

Knowledge of Greek is not necessary: all texts are in English translation. What is necessary is a willingness to participate in seminar meetings each week and supplementary workshops with specially invited guests.  Our focus throughout is on close analysis of the texts, and the attempts the Greeks made to grapple with the world around them through literature. The course inquires into the intellectual development of a culture infused with traditional, mythological accounts of the cosmos. It asks how poetic forms such as epic and tragedy engage with philosophical discourse while creating intense emotional effects on audiences both during antiquity and beyond.  By the end of this course, you will have read a wide selection of Classical Greek literature and be able to perform close readings and comparative analysis of text and culture.  You will also hone your discussion and presentation skills in the seminar format, above all engaging with your peers in joint intellectual inquiry.   ",,Fall.,CLASS 2603,,,,,,,,[nan],2715724.0,Verity Platt,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0

Cities are not just nodes on transaction networks, or physical collections of build form specific to a context and global movements, or diverse places that represent a mix of cultures over time. They are political assemblages in which formal and informal institutions of governance are forged and continue to be shaped as policies change and morph over time. Various processes impacting societies shape the cities where we live, work, and play: ranging from climate change, shifting migration patterns, and large-scale population movements to changes in geo-political power and the technologies of infrastructure, communication, and manufacturing. But what constitutes the city? What concepts allow us to understand how cities grow, shrink, or expand, and shivel or thrive? This course seeks to introduce you to the broad contours of an interdisciplinary body of work that aims to theorize the city.

Does the death penalty reduce crime? Will lowering class sizes increase students' academic achievement? The goal of this course is to train you to become both a high-quality consumer and producer of this type of research. You will learn about several research designs and data analysis methods for identifying causal relationships in data, read and assess empirical papers that apply these methods, and apply these methods to datasets yourself.",Prerequisite: PAM 3100 or equivalent.,Fall.,PAM 4101,,,,,,,,[nan],,,,,,,,,

How do anti-liberal, authoritarian regimes emerge? What makes them tick?  In 1921, a British liberal announced that democracy had already been accepted as the normal and natural form of government. World War I had delivered Europe's old monarchies and autocracies a fatal blow. Three massive continental empires had fallen apart, making way to parliamentary democracies everywhere from Germany to Poland and the Balkans. Yet by the 1930s, few of these democracies were still standing. In the east, a new political experiment had culminated in the rise of a Soviet Empire. In Germany, the democratic elections of 1933 enabled Hitler's rise to power and the growth of a regime unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. In Italy, Mussolini stamped parliamentary democracy under his foot, proclaiming the victory of totalitarianism. A variety of authoritarian regimes arose in between these extremes. They formed alliances and battled each other: at first in the Spanish Civil War and then in World War II. In this seminar, we will closely examine the rise and fall of democracies and anti-democratic regimes in Europe between the two world wars, in order to understand how democracy and authoritarianism are related and what kinds of challenges democracies have faced - both in the past and at present.",,Spring.,HIST 2165,,,,,,,,[nan],2628183.0,Cristina Florea,4.0,4.0,3.8,75.0,,,

The International Labor Organization (ILO) is the organization mandated to design and supervise international labor rights; yet, governments have plucked some of those rights out of the ILO system of governance and have dropped them into their own legal instruments, including their bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that are backed with economic sanctions. In addition, other United Nations (UN) human rights agencies risk clashing with the ILO, given the intersection between their human rights and the ILO's fundamental labor rights. As governments and various UN agencies assign their own meanings and sanctions to international labor law, we are left to question the ILO's contemporary role and purpose in the world of work.

This course provides an integrative introduction to these disciplinary perspectives on cities so students acquire an overview of the key systems, processes, and technologies that must be managed, operated, and maintained in any urban center. The goal of the class is to unpack the complex interplay among institutions, markets, and citizens in the context of the financial, political, administrative, and legal policies that exist in urban communities so that students can understand urban systems in a holistic manner. We will deploy the lenses of three defining cornerstones of urban environments - institutions; real estate; and mass transit - to examine the management of cities and conflicts that arise within them, the design and use of public spaces and infrastructure, and the relationship between the public and the private spheres. The course pedagogy is a mix of participatory learning in the classroom and field visits/labs and expert lectures. The course will equip students with the conceptual and analytical tools necessary to ensure equitable, sustainable, and financially and politically viable approaches to urban challenges.

Indeed, many cases are lost, won, or settled because of information gleaned at a deposition. Attorneys also often modify trial strategies because of a witness's performance at a deposition. Because depositions play such an important role in litigation, the majority of junior litigation attorneys can expect to deal with depositions in some manner from the very start of their careers. This introductory course will expose students to several facets of a deposition: preparing for deposition, asking questions at a deposition, defending the witness at a deposition, using documents at a deposition, and reviewing the transcript of a deposition. Students can expect to take and defend mock depositions and to observe and critique their fellow students' deposition skills.

What should a lawyer do when her professional duties conflict with her financial interests or obligations to friends or family? How does the legal profession's monopoly on the right to give legal advice shape the justice system?

Legal interaction between Africa and Europe, which began before colonial rule, intensified during the colonial period and has continued after independence. During the Colonial period, the Common Law and Civil law were imported into Africa and operated alongside customary law. The result is that pluralism of law is a common feature of legal systems in nearly all African states.
